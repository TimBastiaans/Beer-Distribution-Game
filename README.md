# Beer-Distribution-Game
Worked as part of a 25-member team on implementing a better version of the "Beer Distribution Game" that will solve the limitations of previous versions. Me and four other students were responsible of the UI, testing, intergration and all the small side notes.

Technologies used: Kotlin, Spring, JavaFX and ANTLR4
